7. Creating a Cluster Template
================================

VC3 allows users to create "Cluster Templates" that describe the components of
their virtual cluster, including number of head nodes, worker nodes, etc. We
currently support HTCondor and WorkQueue clusters with dynamic worker nodes,
and fixed head nodes.

To define a new template, click the "Cluster Templates" link on the left panel.
You'll be able to give your cluster a name, select framework, and number of
workers. Click "Define Cluster" to finish creating the template.
