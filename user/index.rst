|Virtual Clusters for Community Computation|, or |VC3|, is a platform for connecting
clusters, grids, and clouds. VC3 can run overlay systems for a variety of
cluster frameworks to make disparate resources appear as a single "virtual"
resource for collaborative science.

.. note::

    This portion of |VC3|'s documentation does not cover installation. See
    the :ref:`installation-guide` section for how to install |VC3|.


Prerequisites
